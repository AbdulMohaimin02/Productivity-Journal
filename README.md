# Productivity-Journal
An all in one journal ready for your daily productivity needs.


The Front End for this journal was made as a part of our multiverse bootcamp by me and Deniz(The other contributor). We wanted our project to be a
reflection of what we had covered in our bootcamp and apply those principles into a working project.


This Front end is able to do CRUD operations by sending requests to our other team memeber's backend API.
